    <h3>Director of Technology</h3>
    <h4>Spotlight PA</h4>
    <h5>May 2010 - Present</h5>
    <p>
      I am the Technology Director for Spotlight PA and directly responsible for every aspect of Spotlight PA's online presence. Spotlight PA is a non-profit newsroom dedicated to providing nonpartisan investigative journalism about Pennsylvania government and urgent issues to media distribution partners across the state. Under my technical leadership, we have gone from not publishing whatsoever to having hundreds of thousands of monthly unique visitors on our own site plus several times more on our partner sites; I created a portal for distributing content to our more than ninety statewide partners; we successfully launched four ongoing newsletters; we opened a regional branch in State College, PA; and Spotlight PA has attracted thousands of individual small donors in addition to other funding sources.

      As a Newsroom Product Engineer for Tribune Publishing at The Baltimore Sun, I was responsible for full stack web development at The Sun. I reduced AWS costs for The Sun by nearly half, improved security, built continuous integration and deployment pipelines, instituted code review, modernized existing web projects, and launched new sites.

      At Ad Hoc, I was a Senior Software Engineer. Ad Hoc is a remote-based contractor specializing in bringing industry best practices to government web services.
